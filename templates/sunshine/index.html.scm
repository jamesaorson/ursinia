The scene is brighter and more colorful, with a greater variety of wildflowers and vibrant butterflies. The baby bear is fluffier, with sparkling, more expressive eyes, capturing a sense of wonder and playfulness. The meadow radiates with an almost fairy-tale-like charm under a brighter, sunnier sky."))))))
