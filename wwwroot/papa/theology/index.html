      My Theological Roadmap

      <h3>What is this roadmap?</h3>
      <p>
        A theological roadmap represents my entire thought process behind my theory of God. <a
           href="#ontology"><strong>This is my ontology</strong></a>. This is how I understand the nature of reality and
        existence, from my own reality and existence.
      </p>
      <h3>What is my background?</h3>
      <p>
        I was raised in a protestant Christian home. I want to prequalify a few things, and maybe expose myself a bit
        here. I went to <a href="http://www.mtzcc.com/">this church</a> growing up. If you read, the beliefs are quite
        sparse, and may leave some of you very wary. I want to let you know that this church has <em>PLENTY</em> more
        rules they are not exposing. There are a large set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law">bylaws</a>
        that set up various levels of rules, from elder voting structure, to whether or not women could serve communion,
        to how to spend money inside versus outside of the building. <strong>I will boil it down for you:</strong> this
        was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminianism">Arminian</a> church, with highly conservative and
        fundamentalist tendencies. This caused a lot of issues for me, and I will say right now that I would not attend
        a church believing as this church does today. I was very involved in this church and believed myself a
        Christian, but this changed after I entered college.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to <a href="https://cedarville.edu">Cedarville University</a> for college, my parents not understanding
        the theological differences, and myself just wanting to escape my original life. It was here that I scraped
        together what I will lay out before you now.

      <h3 id="ontology-structure"><a href="#ontology-structure">How this is structured?</a></h3>
      <p>
        I will likely want to cycle back to real-world topics I have something to say on. I will title these sections
        and backport new entries if needed. For example, <a
           href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> will by discussed, as I believe they are
        significant in the story of humanity, regardless of your philisophical persuasion. Besides, I used one to
        generate the bear images for this site, so you have now definitely been affected by one, it's time to think
        about them.

          <h3 id="what-is-reality"><a href="#what-is-reality">What is the reality I perceive?</a></h3>
          <p>
            I gave you a hint already, I say "I perceive". I go with <a
               href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes/">Descartes</a> here.
          </p>

          <p>
            "cogito, ergo sum,"
          </p>

          <p>
            "I think, therefore I am"
          </p>

          <p>
            At a minimum, I am something and I want to know further what that is. I seem to perceive things, but I am
            told there are others who cannot assume to have certain senses. On top of that, I am not <a
               href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy">tetrachromatic</a> so I know I already "cannot see"
            some colors. Some animals use echolocation, or have the ability to visualize infrared, or can sense EM waves
            as a geolocator. At any rate, my "am"ness is bound by some set of perceptions. All of these statements about
            animals are themselves bound by the abilities of perception available to a human. Can we be certain a dog
            sees no color?
          </p>

          <p>
            It feels like a "brain in a vat" problem to consider this for too long, so instead I work to assume I "can"
            perceive reality through my senses in a sensible way. I recognize the senses and perception to be both
            limited and corruptible, so parity must be gained via introspection, thinking, and communication with other
            perceiving beings.
          </p>

          <div>
            <h3 id="what-is-reality-topics"><a href="#what-is-reality-topics">Woohoo, topics!</a></h3>
            <h4 id="what-is-reality-yhwh"><a href="#what-is-reality-yhwh">The name of God</a></h4>
            <p>
              Did Descartes choose his wording as a cheeky nod to the name of God? If God is real, then did Descartes
              have a choice not to make this nod? I like to think it's a joke from on high. A reference to <a
                 href="/bible/versions/bsb#romans">His word in Romans 1</a>, that the thought of
              any being necessitates the "I am" of Yahweh.
            </p>

            <h4 id="what-is-reality-llms"><a href="#what-is-reality-llms">LLMs</a></h4>
            <p>
              I want to spend a second here due to the emergence of <a
                 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> and the fears surrounding <a
                 href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">AGI</a>. "Am"ness does not translate to
              "dignity". For me, "I" think, therefore "I" am. The only actor I can certainly make a statement for is
              myself. <strong>However</strong>, I accept extrapolation as an axiom of logic. <em>The AI is
                thinking</em>, <strong>therefore it is</strong>. <em>My cat thinks</em>, <strong>therefore it
                is</strong>. <em>A rock does not think</em> (as far as I know), <strong>but it is</strong>. Does an atom
              think? Maybe. Zoom back a bit again, but to the human cell. The cell is effectively an independent
              "being". An "am". Does it think? I go through this not to say it is profound, but rather the opposite.
              <strong>"Am"ness is common and prerequisite for conversation</strong>. If I were a brain in a vat, I still
              "am" and must reason with my "am"ness.
