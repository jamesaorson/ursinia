                <p>
                    I have been working on the <a href="https://github.com/autobutler-ai/autobutler.ai">Autobutler
                        project</a>
                    for a while now. You can read more about it <a href="https://autobutler.ai">here</a>.
                    <br />
                    A hosted instance of it is available at: <a
                        href="http://autobutler.org/">http://autobutler.org/</a>,
                    and yes, that is HTTP, not HTTPS, for the time being.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I intend to track the state of development through this blog, and so I will mostly be shoving images
                    onto this page and just whining about the current state of things, so here goes!
                </p>
                <section id="2025-09-27-state-of-affairs">
                    <h3><a href="#2025-09-27-state-of-affairs">State of affairs</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        We have a few major features present in a few rough states
                    <ul>
                        <a href="http://autobutler.org/chat">Chatbot</a> - Pretty much complete, except the OpenAI API
                        interface changed out from under us again, so it is not functioning in development, however, it
                        works in the deployed version for some reason. Overall though, it is incredibly snappy and
                        responsive, unlike every single LLM chatbot I have ever used before. Pretty pathetic UI
                        programming on the part of all companies in the space right now.
                        <br />

                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <a href="http://autobutler.org/files">File Explorer</a> - You can now manage a simple filesystem
                        with Autobutler, with embedded viewing capabilities for many file types.
                        <br />
                        <img src="/papa/devlog/autobutler/images/2025-09-27/files.png" alt="File Explorer UI"
                            width="800" />
                        <br />
                        In Google Drive, you cannot view a lot of the most simple file types, like plaintext,
                        JSON, XML, CSV, etc. This is incredibly dumb and frustrating, so Autobutler supports that by
                        default as a fallback. We also already support PDF and video viewing support, and a simple docx
                        editor is in place (with some bugs at the present moment, but that is expected with how fast I
                        have been writing things). In Google Drive, you get shipped off to a whole new website in a
                        different tab to work on documents, sheets, powerpoints, etc. Our intention is to keep
                        everything embedded in the file explorer, to retain simplicity and continuity of the user's
                        experience working with their files. If they need to focus and get more screenspace, we will
                        support that as well, but not at the current moment.

                        <a href="http://autobutler.org/calendar">Calendar</a> - Last feature for now, we have a really
                        basic calendar setup, backed by Sqlite. You can create and edit events on a calendar grid, and
                        that is about it for now. Eventually, we want to integrate this with an internal email system
                        (which is being worked on at the present moment), so you can manage them all as related objects.

                <section id="2025-09-27-next-steps">
                    <h3><a href="#2025-09-27-next-steps">Next Steps</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        The next steps for Autobutler are to get the email system working, and then to cleanup and
                        normalize the UI. I think it is obvious why we want the email working, as that is sort of a
                        foundational component of a home document/office suite.
                        <br />
                        Normalizing the UI is clear also to anyone who uses the system, as there are a few different
                        "styles" happening right now. This is mostly the fault of using <a
                            href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind</a>, rather than writing my own component classes.
                        We have been writing all of our UI code though in a componentized manner, so we should be able
                        to fix this pretty quickly, by either tossing Tailwind for our own component classes, leaving
                        Tailwind as strictly a rapid prototyping tool, or just going through our components in a
                        disciplined manner and conforming them to one another. I am leaning towards the first option, as
                        Tailwind is definitely helpful for the prototyping phase and just making it all work, but we
                        will continue to have this inconsistency problem for as long as our CSS is not centralized and
                        normalized. Also, we are doing Autobutler in a no-build environment, so we cannot take advantage
                        of Tailwind's full feature set, and are just directly using their development JS and CSS library
                        as is. We are not really utilizing the JS library as far as I can tell, so we can feasibly
                        consider all Tailwind to be for prototyping, limiting how often we ever actually ship it to our
                        customers.

                    <h3><a href="#2025-09-27-fun-things">Fun Things</a></h3>
                    <p>
                        I came to realize that we are going down the same path as <a
                            href="https://world.hey.com/dhh">DHH</a>'s <a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> in some kind of
                        way, as that is <a href="https://37signals.com/">37Signals</a>'s take on email and calendar.
                        They also have a project called <a href="https://once.com">Once</a>, where they are creating
                        buy-once own-forever software, again, similar to what we are doing with Autobutler. I have a lot
                        of respect for DHH and his work, so I find it funny that we are sort of converging on the same
                        ideas independently, and it would be quite a thrill if we ended up collaborating, or competing,
                        in the future.
