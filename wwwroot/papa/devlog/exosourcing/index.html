      <p>
        Working on a few different things today. I had some work to do, but being friday it is mostly a day for putting
        through my PRs, and code review when I can. I also am ideating on how I want to extend and work on Exosourcing.
        I have watched a few different videos on the topic of constructors, the rule of 5, and memory layouts of types
        in C/C++.
